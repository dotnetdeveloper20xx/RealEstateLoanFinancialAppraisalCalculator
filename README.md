# Real Estate Loan Management System

## Project Overview
The **Real Estate Loan Management System** is an **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API** microservice-based application that enables real estate developers to perform financial appraisals by inputting financial parameters and generating multiple calculated financial models. Users can experiment with different interest rates, term lengths, and purchase prices to obtain optimal financial projections.

The system follows **Clean Architecture, CQRS, Repository Pattern, and EF Core** and is built using **Azure Serverless Services** for scalability and performance.

## **Architecture Overview**

### **What is this project?**
This project allows users to:
- Input real estate project costs, values, rental income, and loan parameters.
- Generate financial appraisal models based on input values.
- Experiment with financial parameters to compare different models.
- Persist input and calculated models in **Azure SQL** and **Azure Cosmos DB**.
- Securely access and manage loan models via **JWT authentication & role-based access control**.
- Deploy and scale using **Azure Serverless Services**.

---

### **Why this architecture?**
- **Microservices-based Design**: Enables modular development and scaling.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.
- **CQRS & Event-Driven Architecture**: Enhances performance and decouples reads/writes.
- **Azure Serverless Services**: Reduces infrastructure overhead and optimizes costs.
- **Secure Web API**: Implements industry-best security practices (JWT, Role-Based Access Control, Azure Key Vault).
- **Centralized Logging & Monitoring**: Uses **Azure Application Insights** for tracking.
- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**: Implements **Azure DevOps** for seamless deployment.

### **Microservices Breakdown**

#### **1. Loan Management API**
Handles **user authentication, loan input storage, and retrieval**.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /loans/create` → Submit input model.
  - `GET /loans/{id}` → Retrieve loan input model.
  - `GET /loans/{id}/calculated-models` → Retrieve previous models.
  - `PUT /loans/{id}` → Update loan model.
  - `DELETE /loans/{id}` → Delete loan model.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API**
  - **EF Core with Azure SQL**
  - **Azure Cosmos DB for historical data**

#### **2. Financial Appraisal API**
Handles **financial calculations based on user inputs**.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /calculations/generate` → Generate financial appraisal model.
  - `GET /calculations/{id}` → Retrieve a specific calculated model.
  - `POST /calculations/experiment` → Test different financial parameters.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API**
  - **CQRS Pattern**
  - **Azure Functions** (Async calculations)
  - **Fluent Validation** (Validates user input)

#### **3. User Management API**
Handles **authentication and security**.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /auth/register` → Register new users.
  - `POST /auth/login` → Authenticate user & return JWT token.
  - `GET /auth/userinfo` → Fetch logged-in user details.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API**
  - **JWT Authentication & Role-Based Authorization**
  - **Azure Key Vault** (Securing credentials)

---

### **Database Design**

#### **Azure SQL (Structured Data)**
- **Loan Table** (Stores user input models).
- **CalculatedModels Table** (Stores calculated financial results).

#### **Azure Cosmos DB (Unstructured Data)**
- Stores historical models, logs, and previous user experiments.

## **Security & Best Practices**
- **Secure Web API**: Implements JWT-based authentication & RBAC.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Protects API keys, database credentials.
- **Centralized Exception Handling**: Uses Middleware-based logging.
- **Fluent Validation**: Ensures valid user inputs.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Uses Azure Application Insights for tracking.

---

## **Deployment & CI/CD Strategy**
- **Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automates **build, test, and deployment**.
  - Deploys microservices as **Azure App Services** or **Containers**.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Uses **Bicep or Terraform** for Azure resource provisioning.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **GraphQL API Support** - Enables flexible data fetching.
2. **Machine Learning Integration** - Advanced financial analysis.
3. **Real-time Loan Monitoring Dashboard** - Uses **SignalR**.
4. **Mobile Application** - Extend service to mobile users.
5. **Multi-Tenancy Support** - Serve multiple real estate firms.
6. **Enhanced Loan Analytics** - Power BI & predictive modeling.
